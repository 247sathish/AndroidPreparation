**Interviewer: "Can you explain the implementation of Google Login in Android?"**

Candidate: "Certainly! Implementing Google Login in Android allows users to sign in to your app using their Google accounts. Here's an overview of the process:

1. Set Up Project in Google Cloud Console:
   - Create a new project or use an existing one in the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Enable the necessary APIs: Google Sign-In and Google People API.

2. Obtain OAuth 2.0 Credentials:
   - In the Google Cloud Console, create credentials for your Android app.
   - Provide the package name and the SHA-1 fingerprint of your signing key.

3. Integrate Google Sign-In API in Your Android App:
   - Add the necessary dependencies in the `build.gradle` file of your app module.
   - Initialize GoogleSignInOptions with the OAuth 2.0 client ID obtained from the credentials.

4. Implement Google Sign-In Button:
   - Add a sign-in button in your app's UI (e.g., `SignInButton` provided by the Google Sign-In API).
   - Set an `OnClickListener` to trigger the sign-in process.

5. Request Google Account Sign-In:
   - When the sign-in button is clicked, create a `GoogleSignInClient` using the configured `GoogleSignInOptions`.
   - Start the sign-in intent using `startActivityForResult()`, passing the `GoogleSignInClient.getSignInIntent()`.

6. Handle the Sign-In Result:
   - In the `onActivityResult()` method, handle the result from the sign-in intent.
   - If successful, you'll receive a `GoogleSignInAccount` containing the user's information.

7. Use Google Sign-In Information:
   - After successful sign-in, you can access user information like display name, email, profile picture, etc., from the `GoogleSignInAccount`.
   - Use this information to customize the user experience within your app.

8. Handle Sign-Out (Optional):
   - Provide a sign-out option for users and revoke their access token when they sign out.
