6. Prepare for Content Rating:
   - Fill out a content rating questionnaire based on the app's content and features.
   - This helps determine the appropriate age-based rating for the app.

7. Upload the App to the Play Console:
   - Log in to the Google Play Console.
   - Create a new app listing and upload the APK or AAB file.
   - Fill out all required details, such as title, description, screenshots, etc.

8. Review and Publish:
   - Submit the app for review by the Play Store team.
