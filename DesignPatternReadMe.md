Here is a list of commonly used design patterns in Android development:

1. Singleton Pattern: Ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides global access to it.

2. Builder Pattern: Provides a step-by-step construction of objects, allowing the creation of complex objects with optional parameters.

3. Factory Pattern: Encapsulates object creation logic in a separate factory class, providing a single point of object creation.

4. Observer Pattern: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes its state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

5. Adapter Pattern: Converts the interface of one class into another interface that clients expect, allowing classes with incompatible interfaces to work together.

6. Decorator Pattern: Allows adding behavior to an object dynamically by wrapping it with a decorator class, without affecting the behavior of other objects of the same class.

7. Strategy Pattern: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable at runtime.

8. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Pattern: Separates the presentation layer (View) from the business logic (ViewModel) and the data (Model), promoting better separation of concerns and testability.

9. Repository Pattern: Provides a single source of truth for accessing data, abstracting the data sources (local database, remote server, etc.) and providing a clean interface for data access.

10. Dependency Injection Pattern: Allows for the inversion of control by injecting dependencies into a class, making the code more modular, testable, and maintainable.

11. Template Method Pattern: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class and allows subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm while keeping the overall structure intact.

12. Command Pattern: Encapsulates a request as an object, decoupling the sender from the receiver, allowing parameterization of clients with different requests, and supporting undoable operations.

These are just a few examples of design patterns commonly used in Android development. Each pattern serves a specific purpose and provides a solution to a particular problem. The choice of design pattern depends on the requirements and the problem you are trying to solve in your application.

Single Pattern:
Certainly! Here's an example of implementing the Singleton Pattern in Android using Kotlin:

```kotlin
class MySingleton private constructor() {
    private var data: String? = null

    fun setData(data: String) {
        this.data = data
    }

    fun getData(): String? {
        return data
    }

    companion object {
        @Volatile
        private var instance: MySingleton? = null

        fun getInstance(): MySingleton {
            return instance ?: synchronized(this) {
                instance ?: MySingleton().also { instance = it }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In the above example, we have a `MySingleton` class with a private constructor, which prevents direct instantiation of the class from outside. The `data` variable is a member variable that can be accessed and modified using getter and setter methods.

The `getInstance()` method is a static method that returns the single instance of the `MySingleton` class. It uses double-checked locking and synchronization to ensure thread safety during the creation of the instance. The `@Volatile` annotation ensures that the `instance` variable is correctly handled across different threads.

To use the singleton instance in your Android application, you can call `MySingleton.getInstance()` to get the instance and then access or modify the data using the appropriate methods.

```kotlin
val singleton = MySingleton.getInstance()
singleton.setData("Hello, Singleton!")

val data = singleton.getData()
Log.d("Singleton", data) // Output: Hello, Singleton!
```

In the above usage example, we obtain the singleton instance using `MySingleton.getInstance()`, set some data using `setData()`, and retrieve the data using `getData()`. The data can then be used as needed in your application.

The Singleton Pattern ensures that there is only one instance of the `MySingleton` class throughout the application, and provides global access to that instance.
