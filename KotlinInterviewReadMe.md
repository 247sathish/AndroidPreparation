# Kotlin

## Kotlin Variable:

### 1.Immutable variables:
```kotlin
val name: String = "John"
val age: Int = 25
val heightInCm: Double = 175.5
```
Immutable variables are declared using the val keyword, and their values cannot be changed after initialization.

### 2.Mutable variables:
```kotlin
var count: Int = 0
var price: Double = 9.99
var message: String = "Hello, world!"
```
Mutable variables are declared using the var keyword, and their values can be changed after initialization.

### 3.Nullable variables:
```kotlin
var phoneNumber: String? = null
var address: String? = "123 Main St"
```
Nullable variables can hold either a non-null value or a null value. They are declared using the ? symbol after the data type.

### 4.Late-initialized variables:
```kotlin
lateinit var myObject: MyClass
```
Late-initialized variables are declared using the lateinit keyword and must be initialized before they are used, otherwise a UninitializedPropertyAccessException will be thrown.

### 5.Constant variables:
```kotlin
const val PI: Double = 3.14159265359
```
Constant variables are declared using the const keyword and must be initialized with a compile-time constant value. They can only be used at the top level or in objects, and not in local scopes or as properties of classes.

### 6.Local variables:
```kotlin
fun calculateArea(width: Int, height: Int): Int {
	val area = width * height
	return area
}
```
Local variables are declared within a function or block of code and can only be accessed within that scope.

### 7.Class-level variables:
```kotlin
class Person(val name: String, var age: Int) {
    var address: String? = null
}
```
Class-level variables are declared within a class and can be accessed by any function or method within that class. In this example, name is an immutable class-level variable, age is a mutable class-level variable, and address is a nullable class-level variable.



## Kotlin Data Type:

### 1.	Byte:

		val byteValue: Byte = 10 
		The Byte data type represents 8-bit signed integers (-128 to 127).

### 2.	Short:

		val shortValue: Short = 1000 
		The Short data type represents 16-bit signed integers (-32768 to 32767).

### 3.	Int:

		val intValue: Int = 100000 
		The Int data type represents 32-bit signed integers (-2^31 to 2^31-1).

### 4.	Long:

		val longValue: Long = 10000000000L 
		The Long data type represents 64-bit signed integers (-2^63 to 2^63-1).

### 5.	Float:

		val floatValue: Float = 3.14f 
		The Float data type represents 32-bit floating-point numbers.

### 6.	Double:

		val doubleValue: Double = 3.14159265359 
		The Double data type represents 64-bit floating-point numbers.

### 7.	Boolean:

		val isOnline: Boolean = true 
		The Boolean data type represents a value that is either true or false.

### 8.	Char:

		val letter: Char = 'a' 
		The Char data type represents a single character.

### 9.	String:

		val message: String = "Hello, world!" 
		The String data type represents a sequence of characters.

### 10.	Array:

		val numbers: IntArray = intArrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) 
		The Array data type represents a collection of values of the same data type.

### 11.	List:

		val fruits: List<String> = listOf("apple", "banana", "orange") 
		The List data type represents an ordered collection of values.

### 12.	Set:

		val vowels: Set<Char> = setOf('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') 
		The Set data type represents an unordered collection of unique values.

### 13.	Map:

		val colors: Map<String, String> = mapOf("red" to "#FF0000", "green" to "#00FF00", "blue" to "#0000FF") 
		The Map data type represents a collection of key-value pairs.


Kotlin Type Conversion
1.	Implicit conversion:
val intValue: Int = 10
val doubleValue: Double = intValue.toDouble() // Implicit conversion from Int to Double
Implicit conversion happens automatically when a value of one data type is assigned to a variable of another data type that can hold that value.
2.	Explicit conversion:
val doubleValue: Double = 3.14159265359
val intValue: Int = doubleValue.toInt() // Explicit conversion from Double to Int
Explicit conversion requires the use of a conversion function to convert a value of one data type to another.
3.	Safe conversion:
val stringValue: String = "10"
val intValue: Int? = stringValue.toIntOrNull() // Safe conversion from String to Int
Safe conversion returns a nullable value that is either the converted value or null if the conversion fails.
4.	Non-safe conversion:
val stringValue: String = "10"
val intValue: Int = stringValue.toInt() // Non-safe conversion from String to Int
Non-safe conversion can throw a NumberFormatException if the conversion fails, so it is recommended to use safe conversion whenever possible.
5.	Range conversion:
val charValue: Char = 'A'
val intValue: Int = charValue.toInt() // Range conversion from Char to Int
Range conversion can be used to convert a value from one data type to another that is within the same range of values.
6.	Widening conversion:
val byteValue: Byte = 10
val intValue: Int = byteValue.toInt() // Widening conversion from Byte to Int
Widening conversion is used to convert a value from a smaller data type to a larger data type without loss of precision.
7.	Narrowing conversion:
val doubleValue: Double = 3.14159265359
val floatValue: Float = doubleValue.toFloat() // Narrowing conversion from Double to Float
Narrowing conversion is used to convert a value from a larger data type to a smaller data type, which may result in loss of precision.

Kotlin Operator
1.Arithmetic operators:
val a = 10
val b = 5
val sum = a + b // Addition
val difference = a - b // Subtraction
val product = a * b // Multiplication
val quotient = a / b // Division
val remainder = a % b // Modulo
2.Comparison operators:
val a = 10
val b = 5
val c = 10
val isEqual = a == b // Equality check
val isNotEqual = a != b // Inequality check
val isGreaterThan = a > b // Greater than check
val isLessThan = a < b // Less than check
val isGreaterThanOrEqual = a >= c // Greater than or equal to check
val isLessThanOrEqual = a <= c // Less than or equal to check
3.Logical operators:
val a = true
val b = false
val andResult = a && b // Logical AND
val orResult = a || b // Logical OR
val notResult = !a // Logical NOT
4.Assignment operators:
var a = 10
a += 5 // Addition and assignment, equivalent to a = a + 5
a -= 5 // Subtraction and assignment, equivalent to a = a - 5
a *= 2 // Multiplication and assignment, equivalent to a = a * 2
a /= 2 // Division and assignment, equivalent to a = a / 2
a %= 3 // Modulo and assignment, equivalent to a = a % 3
5.Increment and decrement operators:
var a = 10
a++ // Post-increment, equivalent to a = a + 1
++a // Pre-increment, equivalent to a = a + 1
a-- // Post-decrement, equivalent to a = a - 1
--a // Pre-decrement, equivalent to a = a - 1
6.Range operator:
val range = 1..10 // Range operator to create a range from 1 to 10 (inclusive)
val rangeExclusive = 1 until 10 // Range operator to create a range from 1 to 9 (exclusive)
val isInRange = 5 in range // Check if a value is in a range
These are some of the commonly used Kotlin operators.

Kotlin Input/Output:
fun main() {
// Taking input from user
print("Enter your name: ")
val name = readLine()

		// Displaying output to user
		println("Hello, $name!")

		// Taking numerical input from user
		print("Enter a number: ")
		val number = readLine()?.toInt()

		// Displaying output based on numerical input
		if (number != null) {
			println("The square of $number is ${number * number}")
		}
	}

Kotlin Comment:
1.The first syntax is the same as Java, which uses the double forward slash // to add a single-line comment:
// This is a single-line comment

	2.The second syntax uses /* to begin a multi-line comment and */ to end it:
		/*
		This is a multi-line comment
		that can span across multiple lines
		*/

Kotlin if Expression:
Sure, here are some examples of using the if expression in Kotlin:
1.Basic usage of if expression:
val number = 5
val result = if (number > 0) "Positive" else "Non-positive"
println(result) // Output: Positive
2.Using if expression as a statement:
val number = 10
if (number % 2 == 0) {
println("$number is even")
} else {
println("$number is odd")
}
// Output: 10 is even
3.Chaining if expressions:
val number = 15
val result = if (number < 0) {
"Negative"
} else if (number == 0) {
"Zero"
} else {
"Positive"
}
println(result) // Output: Positive
4.Using if expression with blocks of code:
val number = 20
val result = if (number > 0) {
println("$number is positive")
"Positive"
} else {
println("$number is non-positive")
"Non-positive"
}
println(result) // Output: 20 is positive\nPositive
5.Using if expression to return a value:
fun max(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
return if (a > b) a else b
}
val result = max(10, 20)
println(result) // Output: 20
I hope these examples help you understand how to use the if expression in Kotlin!


Kotlin when Expression:
1.Matching on a value:
val x = 1
val result = when (x) {
1 -> "One"
2 -> "Two"
else -> "Other"
}
println(result) // "One"
2.Matching on a range:
val x = 5
val result = when (x) {
in 1..10 -> "Between 1 and 10"
in 11..20 -> "Between 11 and 20"
else -> "Other"
}
println(result) // "Between 1 and 10"
3.Matching on a type:
val x: Any = "Hello"
val result = when (x) {
is String -> "It's a string"
is Int -> "It's an integer"
else -> "Other"
}
println(result) // "It's a string"
4.Matching on multiple conditions:
val x = 3
val y = 4
val result = when {
x == 3 && y == 4 -> "Both are true"
x == 3 || y == 4 -> "At least one is true"
else -> "Neither is true"
}
println(result) // "Both are true"
5.Using else as a catch-all:
val x = 6
val result = when (x) {
1 -> "One"
2 -> "Two"
else -> "Some other number"
}
println(result) // "Some other number"




Kotlin for loop
Sure, here are some examples of using the Kotlin for loop:
1.Iterating over a range of numbers:
for (i in 1..5) {
println(i)
}
Output:
1
2
3
4
5
2.Iterating over an array:
val numbers = arrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
for (number in numbers) {
println(number)
}
Output:
1
2
3
4
5
3.Iterating over a collection with an index:
val names = listOf("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie")
for ((index, name) in names.withIndex()) {
println("$index: $name")
}
Output:
0: Alice
1: Bob
2: Charlie
4.Iterating over a string:
val word = "Kotlin"
for (char in word) {
println(char)
}
Output:
K
o
t
l
i
n
5.Iterating over a map:
val map = mapOf("one" to 1, "two" to 2, "three" to 3)
for ((key, value) in map) {
println("$key = $value")
}
Output:
one = 1
two = 2
three = 3

Kotlin while Loop:
Sure, here are some examples of using the Kotlin while loop:
1.Using a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 5:
var i = 1
while (i <= 5) {
println(i)
i++
}
Output:
1
2
3
4
5
2.Using a while loop to print the Fibonacci sequence up to a certain limit:
val limit = 20
var a = 0
var b = 1
while (a <= limit) {
println(a)
val sum = a + b
a = b
b = sum
}
Output:
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
3.Using a while loop to process elements of an array:
val numbers = arrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
var i = 0
while (i < numbers.size) {
println(numbers[i])
i++
}
Output:
1
2
3
4
5


Kotlin do while :
Sure, here are some examples of using the Kotlin do-while loop:
1.Using a do-while loop to print numbers from 1 to 5:
var i = 1
do {
println(i)
i++
} while (i <= 5)
Output:
1
2
3
4
5
2.Using a do-while loop to process elements of an array:
val numbers = arrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
var i = 0
do {
println(numbers[i])
i++
} while (i < numbers.size)
Output:
1
2
3
4
5

Return and Jump Kotlin:
Sure, here are some examples of using the return and jump statements in Kotlin:
1.Using the return statement to exit a function early:
fun calculateSum(numbers: List<Int>): Int {
var sum = 0
for (number in numbers) {
if (number < 0) {
return -1
}
sum += number
}
return sum
}
This function calculates the sum of a list of integers. If the list contains a negative number, the function immediately returns -1. Otherwise, it continues to sum up the remaining numbers and returns the result.

	2.Using the break statement to exit a loop early:
		val numbers = arrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
		for (number in numbers) {
			if (number == 3) {
				break
			}
			println(number)
		}
		Output:
		1
		2
	3.This loop iterates over an array of integers and prints each number. However, if the number 3 is encountered, the loop is exited early using the break statement.

		Using the continue statement to skip over an iteration in a loop:
		val numbers = arrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
		for (number in numbers) {
			if (number == 3) {
				continue
			}
			println(number)
		}
		Output:
		1
		2
		4
		5
		This loop iterates over an array of integers and prints each number except for the number 3. When the number 3 is encountered, the loop skips over that iteration using the continue statement.

	4.Using the return statement with a label to exit nested loops:
		outer@ for (i in 1..5) {
			for (j in 1..5) {
				if (i * j > 10) {
					return@outer
				}
				println("$i * $j = ${i * j}")
			}
		}
		Output:
		1 * 1 = 1
		1 * 2 = 2
		1 * 3 = 3
		1 * 4 = 4
		1 * 5 = 5
		2 * 1 = 2
		2 * 2 = 4
		2 * 3 = 6
		2 * 4 = 8
		2 * 5 = 10
		In this example, two nested loops are used to print the multiplication table from 1 to 5. However, if the product of the two numbers is greater than 10, the loops are exited early using the return@outer statement with a label.

	5.Using the throw statement to throw an exception:
		fun divide(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
			if (b == 0) {
				throw IllegalArgumentException("Cannot divide by zero.")
			}
			return a / b
		}
	This function performs integer division of two numbers, but throws an exception if the second number is zero. The throw statement is used to create and throw an exception of type IllegalArgumentException with a custom error message.

Continue Structure in kotlin:
In Kotlin, the continue keyword is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration. Here are some examples of using the continue statement in Kotlin:
1.Skipping even numbers in a loop:
for (i in 1..10) {
if (i % 2 == 0) {
continue
}
println(i)
}
Output:
1
3
5
7
9
This loop iterates over the numbers 1 to 10 and prints only the odd numbers. When an even number is encountered, the continue statement is used to skip that iteration and move on to the next number.

	2.Skipping elements in a list:
		val names = listOf("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Dave", "Eve")
		for (name in names) {
			if (name.length > 4) {
				continue
			}
			println(name)
		}
		Output:

		Copy code
		Bob
		Dave
		Eve
		This loop iterates over a list of names and prints only the names that are four characters or less in length. When a name longer than four characters is encountered, the continue statement is used to skip that iteration.

	3.Skipping nested loops:
		for (i in 1..5) {
			for (j in 1..5) {
				if (i == j) {
					continue
				}
				println("$i,$j")
			}
		}
		Output:
		1,2
		1,3
		1,4
		1,5
		2,1
		2,3
		2,4
		2,5
		3,1
		3,2
		3,4
		3,5
		4,1
		4,2
		4,3
		4,5
		5,1
		5,2
		5,3
		5,4
		In this example, two nested loops are used to print all possible pairs of numbers from 1 to 5, except for pairs where the two numbers are the same. When i and j are equal, the continue statement is used to skip that iteration of the inner loop.

	4.Skipping loop iteration with while loop:
		var i = 0
		while (i < 10) {
			i++
			if (i % 2 == 0) {
				continue
			}
			println(i)
		}
		Output:

		Copy code
		1
		3
		5
		7
		9
		This example is similar to the first example, but the loop is implemented using a while loop instead of a for loop. When an even number is encountered, the continue statement is used to skip that iteration and move on to the next number.


Kotlin Function :
In Kotlin, there are several ways to define and use functions. Here are some examples of using functions in Kotlin:
1.Defining a basic function:
fun addNumbers(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
return a + b
}
This function takes two integer parameters and returns their sum. To call this function, you can simply use its name and provide the required arguments:
val result = addNumbers(3, 4)
println(result) // Output: 7

	2.Defining a function with default parameter:
		fun greet(name: String, greeting: String = "Hello") {
			println("$greeting, $name!")
		}
		This function takes a required name parameter and an optional greeting parameter, which defaults to "Hello". To call this function, you can either provide both parameters:
		greet("Alice", "Hi") // Output: Hi, Alice!
		Or omit the second parameter to use the default value:
		greet("Bob") // Output: Hello, Bob!
		
	3.Defining a function with variable number of arguments:
		fun sum(vararg numbers: Int): Int {
			var total = 0
			for (number in numbers) {
				total += number
			}
			return total
		}
		This function takes a variable number of integer arguments and returns their sum. To call this function, you can provide any number of arguments:
		val result1 = sum(1, 2, 3)
		println(result1) // Output: 6
		val result2 = sum(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
		println(result2) // Output: 150
		
	4.Defining a function with lambda parameter:
		fun printMessage(message: String, printer: (String) -> Unit) {
			printer(message)
		}
		This function takes a required message parameter and a lambda parameter called printer, which takes a single String parameter and returns nothing. To call this function, you can pass a lambda expression that defines how to print the message:
		printMessage("Hello, world!", { println(it) })
		Output:
		Hello, world!
		
	5.Defining a function as a member of a class:
		class Person(val name: String) {
			fun sayHello() {
				println("Hello, my name is $name")
			}
		}
		This class defines a member function called sayHello, which simply prints a greeting message that includes the person's name. To create an instance of this class and call its member function, you can do the following:
		val person = Person("Alice")
		person.sayHello() // Output: Hello, my name is Alice
		These are just a few examples of the many ways you can define and use functions in Kotlin.

Default and Named Argument:
In Kotlin, you can define default values for function parameters, which allows you to call the function without passing a value for that parameter. You can also use named arguments to pass values for specific parameters in any order you want. Here are some examples:
1.Default argument values:
fun greet(name: String = "World") {
println("Hello, $name!")
}

		// Call function with default value
		greet() // Output: Hello, World!

		// Call function with a specific name
		greet("John") // Output: Hello, John!
		In this example, the greet() function has a default value of "World" for the name parameter. You can call the function without passing a value for name, in which case it uses the default value. Alternatively, you can pass a specific name as an argument.

	2.Named arguments:
		fun createUser(name: String, age: Int, email: String) {
			println("Name: $name, Age: $age, Email: $email")
		}

		// Call function with named arguments
		createUser(name = "John", email = "john@example.com", age = 30)
		// Output: Name: John, Age: 30, Email: john@example.com
		In this example, the createUser() function takes three parameters: name, age, and email. You can pass these arguments in any order by using named arguments. This makes it easier to read and understand the function call, especially if you have many parameters or if their types are similar.

	3.Using both default and named arguments:
		fun buyItem(itemName: String, price: Double = 10.0, isOnSale: Boolean = false) {
			val saleText = if (isOnSale) "on sale for " else ""
			println("$itemName is $saleText$$price")
		}

		// Call function with default values
		buyItem("Book")
		// Output: Book is $10.0

		// Call function with named and non-default values
		buyItem(itemName = "Shoes", isOnSale = true, price = 25.0)
		// Output: Shoes is on sale for $25.0
		In this example, the buyItem() function takes three parameters: itemName, price, and isOnSale. The price parameter has a default value of 10.0, and the isOnSale parameter has a default value of false. You can call the function with just the itemName parameter, which uses the default values for price and isOnSale. You can also call the function with named arguments in any order, including passing a non-default value for price and using the default value for isOnSale.

		Using default and named arguments can make your code more concise, readable, and flexible, especially when dealing with complex functions with many parameters.



Kotlin Lambdas :
Lambdas in Kotlin are a way to create functions anonymously without needing to declare a function name. Here are some examples of using lambdas in Kotlin:

	Basic Lambda expression:
		val add = { a: Int, b: Int -> a + b }
		println(add(2, 3)) // Output: 5
	In this example, we define a lambda expression that takes two integer arguments and returns their sum. We assign the lambda to the variable add and then call it with arguments 2 and 3.

	Lambda as a function argument:
		fun performOperation(a: Int, b: Int, operation: (Int, Int) -> Int): Int {
			return operation(a, b)
		}
		println(performOperation(2, 3) { a, b -> a + b }) // Output: 5
	In this example, we define a function performOperation that takes two integer arguments a and b and a lambda expression operation that takes two integers and returns an integer. The performOperation function then calls the operation lambda with arguments a and b and returns the result. We call the performOperation function and pass in a lambda that adds a and b.
	Lambda with receiver:
		fun buildString(builderAction: StringBuilder.() -> Unit): String {
			val stringBuilder = StringBuilder()
			stringBuilder.builderAction()
			return stringBuilder.toString()
		}
		val result = buildString {
			append("Hello, ")
			append("World!")
		}
		println(result) // Output: Hello, World!
	In this example, we define a function buildString that takes a lambda expression builderAction that is an extension function of StringBuilder. The buildString function creates a new StringBuilder instance, calls the builderAction lambda on it, and returns the resulting string. We call the buildString function and pass in a lambda that appends "Hello, " and "World!" to the StringBuilder.
	Lambdas in Kotlin are a powerful feature that can be used in many ways, including higher-order functions, DSLs, and more. They can make your code more concise, flexible, and expressive.


Kotlin Higher order Function :
Kotlin Kotlin Inline Function :



Kotlin Array :
1.Creating an array of integers:
val intArray = arrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
2.Creating an array of strings:
val stringArray = arrayOf("apple", "banana", "orange", "pear")
3.Creating an array of booleans:
val booleanArray = arrayOf(true, false, true)
4.Creating an array of mixed types:
val mixedArray = arrayOf("Hello", 42, true, 3.14)
5.Creating an array of nullable types:
val nullableArray = arrayOfNulls<Int?>(5)
6.Creating an array of a specific type and size:
val intArray = IntArray(5)
7.Accessing array elements:
val fruits = arrayOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
println(fruits[0]) // prints "apple"
8.Updating array elements:
val numbers = arrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
numbers[2] = 10
println(numbers[2]) // prints 10
9.Iterating through an array:
val numbers = arrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
for (number in numbers) {
println(number)
}
10.Checking if an array contains an element:
val numbers = arrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
if (numbers.contains(3)) {
println("The array contains 3")
}

Kotlin String :
Sure, here are some examples of Kotlin strings:
1.Creating a string variable:
val name = "John"
2.Creating a string variable with line breaks:
val message = """
Hello,
This is a multiline string.
"""
3.Creating a string with string interpolation:
val age = 30
val message = "My age is $age"
4.Concatenating strings:
val firstName = "John"
val lastName = "Doe"
val fullName = firstName + " " + lastName
5.Checking if a string is empty:
val name = ""
if (name.isEmpty()) {
println("The name is empty")
}
6.Checking if a string contains a substring:
val message = "Hello, world!"
if (message.contains("world")) {
println("The message contains 'world'")
}
7.Getting the length of a string:
val message = "Hello, world!"
val length = message.length
println("The length of the message is $length")
8.Converting a string to uppercase or lowercase:
val name = "John"
val uppercaseName = name.toUpperCase()
val lowercaseName = name.toLowerCase()
7.Removing whitespace from the beginning and end of a string:
val name = " John "
val trimmedName = name.trim()
8.Splitting a string into an array:
val message = "Hello, world!"
val words = message.split(",")
for (word in words) {
println(word.trim())
}

Exception Handling kotlin:

	1.Using try-catch blocks:
		try {
			// code that may throw an exception
		} catch (e: Exception) {
			// handle the exception
		} finally {
			// code to be executed regardless of whether an exception was thrown or not
		}
	2.Handling specific types of exceptions:
		try {
			// code that may throw a FileNotFoundException
		} catch (e: FileNotFoundException) {
			// handle the FileNotFoundException
		} catch (e: Exception) {
			// handle any other exception
		}
	3.Rethrowing an exception:
		try {
			// code that may throw an exception
		} catch (e: Exception) {
			// handle the exception
			throw e // rethrow the exception
		}
	4.Using the "throw" keyword to throw a new exception:
		fun divide(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
			if (b == 0) {
				throw IllegalArgumentException("Cannot divide by zero")
			}
			return a / b
		}
	5.Using the "finally" block to release resources:
		val file = File("example.txt")
		try {
			// code that reads from or writes to the file
		} catch (e: Exception) {
			// handle the exception
		} finally {
			file.close()
		}
	6.Using the "use" function to automatically release resources:
		val file = File("example.txt")
		file.bufferedReader().use { reader ->
			// code that reads from the file
		}
		// the reader will be automatically closed after the use block
	7.Creating custom exception classes:
		class InvalidInputException(message: String) : Exception(message)

		fun processInput(input: String) {
			if (input.isBlank()) {
				throw InvalidInputException("Input cannot be blank")
			}
			// code that processes the input
		}
	8.Using the "runCatching" function to handle exceptions:
		val result = runCatching {
			// code that may throw an exception
		}
		result.onSuccess {
			// handle the successful result
		}
		result.onFailure {
			// handle the exception
		}
	9.Using the "require" function to check for a condition and throw an exception if it's not met:
		fun divide(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
			require(b != 0) { "Cannot divide by zero" }
			return a / b
		}
	10.Using the "assert" function to check for a condition and throw an AssertionError if it's not met:
		fun calculateDiscount(price: Int, discountPercent: Int): Int {
			assert(discountPercent in 0..100) { "Discount percent must be between 0 and 100" }
			return price * (100 - discountPercent) / 100



try catch in kotlin:

	fun divide(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
		try {
			return a / b
		} catch (e: ArithmeticException) {
			println("Cannot divide by zero")
		}
		return 0
	}
	In this example, the function "divide" attempts to divide "a" by "b" inside the try block. If "b" is zero, an ArithmeticException will be thrown. The catch block catches the exception and prints a message. The function then returns 0 to indicate that the division operation failed.

	You can call the function like this:

		val result = divide(10, 0)
	
	In this case, the function will catch the ArithmeticException and print "Cannot divide by zero". The result variable will be assigned the value 0, which was returned by the function.

	If you call the function with non-zero values for "a" and "b", it will return the result of the division operation:

		val result = divide(10, 2)
	In this case, the function will divide 10 by 2 and return the result, which will be assigned to the result variable. The catch block will not be executed because no exception was thrown in the try block.


Kotlin Multiple catch Block

	fun main(args: Array<String>){  
		try {  
			val a = IntArray(5)  
			a[5] = 10 / 0  
		} catch (e: ArithmeticException) {  
			println("arithmetic exception catch")  
		} catch (e: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException) {  
			println("array index outofbounds exception")  
		} catch (e: Exception) {  
			println("parent exception class")  
		}  
		println("code after try catch...")  
	}  
	
	Output:
	arithmetic exception catch
	code after try catch...


Kotlin Nested try-catch block
fun main(args: Array<String>) {  
val nume = intArrayOf(4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512)  
val deno = intArrayOf(2, 0, 4, 4, 0, 8)  
try {  
for (i in nume.indices) {  
try {  
println(nume[i].toString() + " / " + deno[i] + " is " + nume[i] / deno[i])  
} catch (exc: ArithmeticException) {  
println("Can't divided by Zero!")  
}

			}  
		} catch (exc: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException) {  
			println("Element not found.")  
		}  
	}  
	
	Output:
	4 / 2 is 2
	Can't divided by Zero!
	16 / 4 is 4
	32 / 4 is 8
	Can't divided by Zero!
	128 / 8 is 16
	Element not found.

Kotlin finally Block
Kotlin finally block such block which is always executes whether exception is handled or not. So it is used to execute important code statement.
fun main (args: Array<String>){  
try {  
val data = 5 / 0  
println(data)  
} catch (e: NullPointerException) {  
println(e)  
} finally {  
println("finally block always executes")  
}  
println("below codes...")  
}

	Output:
	finally block always executes
	Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero


Kotlin throw keyword:
Kotlin throw keyword is used to throw an explicit exception. It is used to throw a custom exception.
To throw an exception object we will use the throw-expression.
fun main(args: Array<String>) {  
validate(15)  
println("code after validation check...")  
}  
fun validate(age: Int) {  
if (age < 18)  
throw ArithmeticException("under age")  
else  
println("eligible for drive")  
}

	Output:
	Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: under age


Nullable Non Nullable Types kotlin

	1.Non-nullable types:
		val x: Int = 5
		val name: String = "John"
		val y: Double = 3.14
		In these examples, x, name, and y are all non-nullable types because they cannot hold a null value.

	2.Nullable types:
		var age: Int? = null
		var city: String? = "New York"
		var weight: Double? = 75.5
		In these examples, age, city, and weight are nullable types because they can hold either a value of the specified type or a null value.

	3.Nullable type with safe operator:
		var name: String? = null
		val length = name?.length
		Here, name is a nullable type, and the ?. operator is used to safely access its length property. If name is null, length will also be null instead of throwing a null pointer exception.

	4.Nullable type with null coalescing operator:
		var name: String? = null
		val length = name?.length ?: 0
		Here, the ?: operator is used to provide a default value of 0 in case name is null. If name is not null, its length property will be returned.

	5.Non-nullable type with not-null assertion operator:
		var name: String? = null
		val length = name!!.length
		Here, the !! operator is used to assert that name is not null, and its length property is accessed directly without any null-checks. If name is null, a null pointer exception will be thrown at runtime. This should be used with caution as it can lead to runtime exceptions if used incorrectly.

Kotlin Smart Cast :
In Kotlin, smart casting is a feature that allows the compiler to automatically cast a variable to a more specific type based on certain conditions. This can make code more concise and readable by reducing the need for explicit type casting. Here are some examples of Kotlin smart casting:

	1.Checking type with "is" keyword:
		fun printLength(s: Any) {
			if (s is String) {
				println(s.length)
			}
		}

		printLength("Hello, world!") // Output: 13
		In this example, the is keyword is used to check if the variable s is of type String. If it is, the length property is printed. Since s is only of type Any outside the if block, the smart cast is required to access the length property inside the block.

	2.Checking type with "when" expression:

		fun printLength(s: Any) {
			when (s) {
				is String -> println(s.length)
				is Int -> println(s)
			}
		}

		printLength("Hello, world!") // Output: 13
		printLength(42) // Output: 42
		In this example, the when expression is used to check the type of s. If it is a String, the length property is printed, and if it is an Int, the value of s is printed.

	3.Checking type and nullability:


		fun printLength(s: Any?) {
			if (s is String && s.isNotEmpty()) {
				println(s.length)
			}
		}

		printLength(null) // No output
		printLength("") // No output
		printLength("Hello, world!") // Output: 13
		In this example, the is keyword is used to check if s is of type String and if it is not null and not empty. If all conditions are met, the length property is printed.

	4.Checking type with "as?" operator:


		fun printLength(s: Any?) {
			val str = s as? String
			if (str != null) {
				println(str.length)
			}
		}

		printLength(null) // No output
		printLength(42) // No output
		printLength("Hello, world!") // Output: 13
		In this example, the as? operator is used to cast s to type String. If the cast is successful, the length property is printed. The as? operator returns null if the cast is not possible, so a null check is required to avoid a null pointer exception.		



Unsafe and Safe Cast kotlin:
In Kotlin, there are two main types of casting: safe casting and unsafe casting. Safe casting is performed using the "as?" operator, while unsafe casting is performed using the "as" operator.
Safe casting returns null if the cast fails, while unsafe casting will throw a ClassCastException if the cast fails. Here are some examples of how to use safe and unsafe casting in Kotlin:

	1.Safe casting:
		val x: Any = "Hello"
		val y: String? = x as? String
		println(y) // Output: "Hello"

		val z: Any = 42
		val w: String? = z as? String
		println(w) // Output: null
	2.Unsafe casting:
			val x: Any = "Hello"
			val y: String = x as String
			println(y) // Output: "Hello"
			val z: Any = 42
			val w: String = z as String // Throws ClassCastException
		It's important to note that unsafe casting should be used with caution, as it can cause runtime errors if the cast fails. To avoid these errors, you can use safe casting with a null check or use an if statement to handle the null case:
			val x: Any? = null
			val y: String? = x as? String
			if (y != null) {
				println(y)
			} else {
				println("x cannot be cast to String")
			}
		Another way to handle casting in Kotlin is to use the "is" operator to check the type of an object before casting it:
			val x: Any = "Hello"
			if (x is String) {
				val y: String = x // safe cast here, no need for "as"
				println(y) // Output: "Hello"
			}



Kotlin Elvis Operator :
Sure, here are some examples of using the Kotlin Elvis operator in different scenarios:
1.Providing a default value for a nullable variable:
val nullableValue: String? = null
val result = nullableValue ?: "default value"
println(result) // Output: "default value"
2.Returning a value from a function that might return null:
fun getStringLength(str: String?): Int {
return str?.length ?: 0
}
val length1 = getStringLength("Hello") // length1 = 5
val length2 = getStringLength(null) // length2 = 0
3.Accessing a property of an object that might be null:
data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int?)
val person1: Person? = Person("John", 30)
val person2: Person? = null
val age1 = person1?.age ?: 0 // age1 = 30
val age2 = person2?.age ?: 0 // age2 = 0

	4.Providing a default value for a nullable value in a map:
		val map = mapOf("key1" to "value1", "key2" to null)
		val value1 = map["key1"] ?: "default value" // value1 = "value1"
		val value2 = map["key2"] ?: "default value" // value2 = "default value"
	5.Using the Elvis operator in a lambda expression:
		val nullableString: String? = null
		val result = nullableString?.let { it.length } ?: 0
		println(result) // Output: 0
	In this example, we use the let function to access the length property of nullableString. If nullableString is not null, the let function returns the length, which is then assigned to result. If nullableString is null, the Elvis operator provides a default value of 0.
	The Elvis operator is a useful tool for handling null values in Kotlin. By providing a default value for nullable variables or expressions, it helps prevent null pointer exceptions and makes code more concise and readable.


Mutable Array:

	1.Create an empty mutable array of strings and add elements to it:
		val myArray = mutableListOf<String>()
		myArray.add("apple")
		myArray.add("banana")
		myArray.add("orange")
		println(myArray) // output: [apple, banana, orange]
	2.Create a mutable array with initial values:
		val myArray = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
		println(myArray) // output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
	3.Modify an element in a mutable array:
		val myArray = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3)
		myArray[1] = 4
		println(myArray) // output: [1, 4, 3]
	4.Remove an element from a mutable array:
		val myArray = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3)
		myArray.removeAt(1)
		println(myArray) // output: [1, 3]
	5.Add elements to a mutable array using the addAll() method:
		val myArray = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3)
		myArray.addAll(listOf(4, 5, 6))
		println(myArray) // output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
	6.Sort a mutable array:
		val myArray = mutableListOf(3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5)
		myArray.sort()
		println(myArray) // output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 9]
	6.Reverse a mutable array:
		val myArray = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
		myArray.reverse()
		println(myArray) // output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
	7.Clear all elements from a mutable array:
		val myArray = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3)
		myArray.clear()
		println(myArray) // output: []
	Mutable arrays in Kotlin are very flexible and provide many useful methods for adding, removing, and modifying elements. You can use them in a variety of situations where you need to store and manipulate a collection of data.


Kotlin Collections

	1.List:
		val myList = listOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
		println(myList) // output: [apple, banana, orange]
	2.Mutable List:
		val myMutableList = mutableListOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
		myMutableList.add("grape")
		println(myMutableList) // output: [apple, banana, orange, grape]
	3.Set:
		val mySet = setOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
		println(mySet) // output: [apple, banana, orange]
	4.Mutable Set:

		println(myMap) // output: {apple=1, banana=2, orange=3}
	6.Mutable Map:
		val myMutableMap = mutableMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		myMutableMap.put("grape", 4)
		println(myMutableMap) // output: {apple=1, banana=2, orange=3, grape=4}
	7.Filter a collection:
		val myList = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
		val filteredList = myList.filter { it > 3 }
		println(filteredList) // output: [4, 5]
	8.Map a collection:
		val myList = listOf(1, 2, 3)
		val mappedList = myList.map { it * 2 }
		println(mappedList) // output: [2, 4, 6]
	9.Fold a collection:
		val myList = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
		val foldedValue = myList.fold(0) { acc, value -> acc + value }
		println(foldedValue) // output: 15
	10.Group a collection by a key:
		data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)
		val people = listOf(Person("Alice", 25), Person("Bob", 30), Person("Charlie", 25))
		val groupedPeople = people.groupBy { it.age }
		println(groupedPeople) // output: {25=[Person(name=Alice, age=25), Person(name=Charlie, age=25)], 30=[Person(name=Bob, age=30)]}
	Kotlin collections are very powerful and provide many useful methods for filtering, mapping, folding, grouping, and more. You can use them in a variety of situations where you need to store and manipulate a collection of data.


List: listOf() kotlin:

	1.Create a list of integers:
		val myList = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
		println(myList) // output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
	2.Create a list of strings:
		val myList = listOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
		println(myList) // output: [apple, banana, orange]
	3.Create a list of custom objects:
		data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)
		val myList = listOf(Person("Alice", 25), Person("Bob", 30))
		println(myList) // output: [Person(name=Alice, age=25), Person(name=Bob, age=30)]
	4.Create an empty list:
		val myList = listOf<Int>()
		println(myList) // output: []
	5.Access a specific element of the list:
		val myList = listOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
		val firstElement = myList[0]
		println(firstElement) // output: apple
	6.Get the size of the list:
		val myList = listOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
		val size = myList.size
		println(size) // output: 3
	7.Check if a list contains an element:
		val myList = listOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
		val containsApple = myList.contains("apple")
		println(containsApple) // output: true
	8.Filter the list based on a condition:
		val myList = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
		val filteredList = myList.filter { it > 3 }
		println(filteredList) // output: [4, 5]
	9.Map the list to another list:
		val myList = listOf(1, 2, 3)
		val mappedList = myList.map { it * 2 }
		println(mappedList) // output: [2, 4, 6]
	10.Fold the list to a single value:
		val myList = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
		val foldedValue = myList.fold(0) { acc, value -> acc + value }
		println(foldedValue) // output: 15
	These are just a few examples of what you can do with the listOf() function in Kotlin. The possibilities are endless, and you can use it in a variety of situations where you need to store and manipulate a list of data.


mutableListOf() kotlin:

	Certainly! Here are some examples of working with the mutableListOf() function in Kotlin:

	1.Create a mutable list of integers:
		val myList = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
		println(myList) // output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
	2.Add an element to the mutable list:
		val myList = mutableListOf("apple", "banana")
		myList.add("orange")
		println(myList) // output: [apple, banana, orange]
	3.Remove an element from the mutable list:
		val myList = mutableListOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
		myList.remove("banana")
		println(myList) // output: [apple, orange]
	4.Clear all elements from the mutable list:
		val myList = mutableListOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
		myList.clear()
		println(myList) // output: []
	5.Replace an element in the mutable list:
		val myList = mutableListOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
		myList[1] = "grape"
		println(myList) // output: [apple, grape, orange]
	6.Sort the mutable list:
		val myList = mutableListOf(3, 2, 1, 5, 4)
		myList.sort()
		println(myList) // output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
	7.Filter the mutable list based on a condition:
		val myList = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
		val filteredList = myList.filter { it > 3 }
		println(filteredList) // output: [4, 5]
	8.Map the mutable list to another list:
		val myList = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3)
		val mappedList = myList.map { it * 2 }
		println(mappedList) // output: [2, 4, 6]
	9.Fold the mutable list to a single value:
		val myList = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
		val foldedValue = myList.fold(0) { acc, value -> acc + value }
		println(foldedValue) // output: 15
	10.Check if the mutable list contains an element:
		val myList = mutableListOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
		val containsApple = myList.contains("apple")
		println(containsApple) // output: true
	These are just a few examples of what you can do with the mutableListOf() function in Kotlin. The mutable list allows you to change its elements after its creation, which makes it more flexible than the immutable listOf() function. You can use it in a variety of situations where you need to store and manipulate a list of data that can be changed over time.


Kotlin ArrayList :
In Kotlin, an ArrayList is a resizable array implementation of the MutableList interface. This means that you can add, remove, or modify elements in the list after its creation.

	Here's an example of creating and using an ArrayList in Kotlin:
		
		val arrayList = ArrayList<String>()
		arrayList.add("apple")
		arrayList.add("banana")
		arrayList.add("orange")

		println(arrayList) // output: [apple, banana, orange]

		arrayList.removeAt(1)
		println(arrayList) // output: [apple, orange]

		arrayList[0] = "grape"
		println(arrayList) // output: [grape, orange]
		
	In this example, we create an empty ArrayList of type String using the ArrayList() constructor. We then use the add() method to add three strings to the list. We print the list using println() to verify that the elements were added correctly.

	Next, we use the removeAt() method to remove the element at index 1 (which is "banana"). We print the list again to verify that "banana" was removed.

	Finally, we use the index operator ([]) to replace the first element ("apple") with "grape". We print the list again to verify that the replacement was successful.

	In addition to add(), removeAt(), and the index operator, ArrayList provides many other useful methods for working with lists, such as get(), set(), size, indexOf(), lastIndexOf(), and subList(). You can also use the addAll() method to add multiple elements to the list at once, and the remove() method to remove a specific element from the list.

	Overall, ArrayList is a useful data structure in Kotlin for storing and manipulating lists of elements that can be changed over time.

arrayListOf() kotlin:

	In Kotlin, arrayListOf() is a convenient function to create a new ArrayList. The function returns an ArrayList with the specified elements.

	Here's an example of using arrayListOf() to create a new ArrayList with some initial elements:
	
		val fruits = arrayListOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
	
	In this example, we create a new ArrayList of type String called fruits using the arrayListOf() function. We pass in three String values: "apple", "banana", and "orange". The function creates a new ArrayList object and initializes it with these three elements.

	Once we have the ArrayList object, we can manipulate it just like any other ArrayList object. For example, we can add or remove elements using the add() and remove() methods, access elements using the index operator ([]), and so on.

	Here are some more examples of using arrayListOf():

		// Create an empty ArrayList of type Int
		val numbers = arrayListOf<Int>()

		// Create an ArrayList with a single element
		val single = arrayListOf("hello")

		// Create an ArrayList with multiple elements of different types
		val mixed = arrayListOf("apple", 1, true)
		
	In the second example, we create an ArrayList with a single element "hello". In the third example, we create an ArrayList with three elements: "apple", 1 (an Int), and true (a Boolean). Note that Kotlin's type inference allows us to create a list of elements of different types without having to specify the type explicitly.

	Overall, arrayListOf() is a convenient function for creating new ArrayList objects with initial elements. You can use it whenever you need to create an ArrayList with some predefined elements, without having to call the add() method repeatedly.



Map: mapOf() kotlin

	Sure, here are some examples of working with mapOf() in Kotlin:

	1.Create an empty Map:
		val map = mapOf<String, Int>()
	2.Create a Map with some initial key-value pairs:
		val map = mapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
	3.Access a value by key:
		val map = mapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		val value = map["banana"]
	4.Add a new key-value pair to the Map:
		val map = mutableMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		map["grape"] = 4
	5.Remove a key-value pair from the Map:
		val map = mutableMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		map.remove("banana")
	6.Get the size of the Map:
		val map = mapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		val size = map.size
	7.Check if the Map contains a key:
		val map = mapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		val containsApple = map.containsKey("apple")
	8.Check if the Map contains a value:
		val map = mapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		val containsValueTwo = map.containsValue(2)
	9.Iterate over the key-value pairs in the Map:
		val map = mapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		for ((key, value) in map) {
			println("$key -> $value")
		}
	10.Create a mutable Map and modify it:
		val map = mutableMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		map["apple"] = 4
		map.remove("banana")
	11.Create a Map with values computed from the keys:
		val fruits = listOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
		val map = fruits.associateWith { fruit -> fruit.length }
	In this example, we create a List of fruits, and then use the associateWith() function to create a Map where each fruit is associated with its length. The associateWith() function takes a lambda expression that computes a value from each key (in this case, the length of the fruit), and returns a new Map with the same keys and computed values.
	These are just a few examples of what you can do with Map and mapOf() in Kotlin. The classes provide many other methods and properties that you can use to manipulate the map and access its elements. Map is a very useful data structure when you need to store and manipulate key-value pairs.

Kotlin HashMap:

	Sure, here are some examples of working with HashMap in Kotlin:
	1.Create an empty HashMap:
		val hashMap = HashMap<String, Int>()
	2.Create a HashMap with some initial key-value pairs:
		val hashMap = hashMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
	3.Access a value by key:
		val hashMap = hashMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		val value = hashMap["banana"]
	4.Add a new key-value pair to the HashMap:
		val hashMap = mutableMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		hashMap["grape"] = 4
	5.Remove a key-value pair from the HashMap:
		val hashMap = mutableMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		hashMap.remove("banana")
	6.Get the size of the HashMap:
		val hashMap = hashMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		val size = hashMap.size
	7.Check if the HashMap contains a key:
		val hashMap = hashMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		val containsApple = hashMap.containsKey("apple")
	8.Check if the HashMap contains a value:
		val hashMap = hashMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		val containsValueTwo = hashMap.containsValue(2)
	9.Iterate over the key-value pairs in the HashMap:
		val hashMap = hashMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		for ((key, value) in hashMap) {
			println("$key -> $value")
		}
	10.Create a mutable HashMap and modify it:
		val hashMap = mutableMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		hashMap["apple"] = 4
		hashMap.remove("banana")
	11.Create a HashMap with values computed from the keys:
		val fruits = listOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
		val hashMap = HashMap<String, Int>()
		for (fruit in fruits) {
			hashMap[fruit] = fruit.length
		}
	In this example, we create a List of fruits, and then use a for loop to create a HashMap where each fruit is associated with its length. We iterate over the List of fruits, and for each fruit, we add a key-value pair to the HashMap where the key is the fruit itself, and the value is the length of the fruit.

	These are just a few examples of what you can do with HashMap in Kotlin. The class provides many other methods and properties that you can use to manipulate the map and access its elements. HashMap is a very useful data structure when you need to store and manipulate key-value pairs, and it is often used in conjunction with other Kotlin collections.


hashMapOf() Kotlin:

	Certainly! Here are some examples of working with hashMapOf() in Kotlin:
	1.Create an empty HashMap:
		val hashMap = hashMapOf<String, Int>()
	2.Create a HashMap with some initial key-value pairs:
		val hashMap = hashMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
	3.Access a value by key:
		val hashMap = hashMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		val value = hashMap["banana"]
	4.Add a new key-value pair to the HashMap:
		val hashMap = hashMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		hashMap["grape"] = 4
	5.Remove a key-value pair from the HashMap:
		val hashMap = hashMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		hashMap.remove("banana")
	6.Get the size of the HashMap:
		val hashMap = hashMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		val size = hashMap.size
	7.Check if the HashMap contains a key:
		val hashMap = hashMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		val containsApple = hashMap.containsKey("apple")
	8.Check if the HashMap contains a value:
		val hashMap = hashMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		val containsValueTwo = hashMap.containsValue(2)
	9.Iterate over the key-value pairs in the HashMap:
		val hashMap = hashMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		for ((key, value) in hashMap) {
			println("$key -> $value")
		}
	10.Create a mutable HashMap and modify it:
		val hashMap = hashMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		hashMap["apple"] = 4
		hashMap.remove("banana")
	These are just a few examples of what you can do with hashMapOf() in Kotlin. The class provides many other methods and properties that you can use to manipulate the map and access its elements. HashMap is a very useful data structure when you need to store and manipulate key-value pairs, and it is often used in conjunction with other Kotlin collections.



mutableMapOf() kotlin:

	Certainly! Here are some examples of working with mutableMapOf() in Kotlin:
	1.Create an empty MutableMap:
		val mutableMap = mutableMapOf<String, Int>()
	2.Create a MutableMap with some initial key-value pairs:
		val mutableMap = mutableMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
	3.Access a value by key:
		val mutableMap = mutableMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		val value = mutableMap["banana"]
	4.Add a new key-value pair to the MutableMap:
		val mutableMap = mutableMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		mutableMap["grape"] = 4
	5.Remove a key-value pair from the MutableMap:
		val mutableMap = mutableMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		mutableMap.remove("banana")
	6.Get the size of the MutableMap:
		val mutableMap = mutableMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		val size = mutableMap.size
	7.Check if the MutableMap contains a key:
		val mutableMap = mutableMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		val containsApple = mutableMap.containsKey("apple")
	8.Check if the MutableMap contains a value:
		val mutableMap = mutableMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		val containsValueTwo = mutableMap.containsValue(2)
	9.Iterate over the key-value pairs in the MutableMap:	
		val mutableMap = mutableMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		for ((key, value) in mutableMap) {
			println("$key -> $value")
		}
	10.Create a mutable MutableMap and modify it:
		val mutableMap = mutableMapOf("apple" to 1, "banana" to 2, "orange" to 3)
		mutableMap["apple"] = 4
		mutableMap.remove("banana")
	These are just a few examples of what you can do with mutableMapOf() in Kotlin. The class provides many other methods and properties that you can use to manipulate the map and access its elements. MutableMap is a very useful data structure when you need to store and manipulate key-value pairs, and it is often used in conjunction with other Kotlin collections.

Set: setOf() Kotlin:
Sure, here are some examples of working with setOf() in Kotlin:
1.Create an empty Set:
val set = setOf<String>()
2.Create a Set with some initial elements:
val set = setOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
3.Check if an element is in the Set:
val set = setOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
val containsApple = set.contains("apple")
4.Add an element to the Set:
val set = setOf("apple", "banana", "orange").toMutableSet()
set.add("grape")
5.Remove an element from the Set:
val set = setOf("apple", "banana", "orange").toMutableSet()
set.remove("banana")
6.Get the size of the Set:
val set = setOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
val size = set.size
7.Iterate over the elements in the Set:
val set = setOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
for (element in set) {
println(element)
}
8.Create a Set and combine it with another Set:
val set1 = setOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
val set2 = setOf("grape", "banana")
val combinedSet = set1.union(set2)
9.Create a Set and intersect it with another Set:
val set1 = setOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
val set2 = setOf("grape", "banana")
val intersectedSet = set1.intersect(set2)
10.Create a Set and subtract another Set from it:
val set1 = setOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
val set2 = setOf("grape", "banana")
val subtractedSet = set1.subtract(set2)
These are just a few examples of what you can do with setOf() in Kotlin. The class provides many other methods and properties that you can use to manipulate the set and access its elements. Set is a very useful data structure when you need to store unique elements and perform set operations on them, and it is often used in conjunction with other Kotlin collections.

mutableSetOf() kotlin
In Kotlin, the mutableSetOf() function is used to create a new empty mutable set. Here are some of the possible solutions for using mutableSetOf():

	1.Create an empty mutable set of strings
		val setOfStrings: MutableSet<String> = mutableSetOf()
	2.Create an empty mutable set of integers:
		val setOfIntegers: MutableSet<Int> = mutableSetOf()
	3.Create an empty mutable set of custom objects:
		data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)
		val setOfPeople: MutableSet<Person> = mutableSetOf()
	4.Create a mutable set with initial values:
		val setOfNumbers: MutableSet<Int> = mutableSetOf(1, 2, 3, 4)
	5.Create a mutable set using the spread operator:
		val setOfNumbers: MutableSet<Int> = mutableSetOf(*arrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4))
	6.Create a mutable set using a range:
		val setOfNumbers: MutableSet<Int> = (1..10).toMutableSet()
	Note that since mutableSetOf() returns a mutable set, you can add or remove elements from the set as needed.

hashSetOf() kotlin:
hashSetOf() is a function in Kotlin that creates a new HashSet collection with the elements provided as arguments. Here are some possible ways to use hashSetOf() in Kotlin:
1.Creating a HashSet with initial elements:
val fruits = hashSetOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
This creates a new HashSet called fruits that contains the elements "apple", "banana", and "orange".
2.Creating an empty HashSet and adding elements later:
val numbers = hashSetOf<Int>()
numbers.add(1)
numbers.add(2)
numbers.add(3)
This creates a new HashSet called numbers that initially contains no elements. Elements can be added to it using the add() method.

	3.Creating a HashSet from an existing collection:
		val list = listOf("apple", "banana", "orange")
		val set = hashSetOf(*list.toTypedArray())
		This creates a new HashSet called set with the same elements as the list collection.

	4.Creating a HashSet with a single element:
		val set = hashSetOf("apple")
		This creates a new HashSet called set that contains the single element "apple".
	5.Creating a HashSet with no initial elements:
		val set = hashSetOf<String>()
		This creates a new empty HashSet called set. Note that you need to specify the type parameter <String> since hashSetOf() creates a HashSet with type inference.

	These are some of the possible ways to use hashSetOf() in Kotlin. It is a convenient way to create a HashSet with a set of initial elements without having to manually add each element individually.


Kotlin Reflection::
Kotlin Reflection is a powerful feature that allows developers to inspect, analyze, and modify code at runtime. Here are some examples of Kotlin Reflection that demonstrate its capabilities:

	1.Getting the class name of an object:
		val obj = MyClass()
		val className = obj::class.simpleName
		println(className) // prints "MyClass"
	2.Accessing properties and functions of a class at runtime:
		class MyClass(val name: String) {
			fun sayHello() {
				println("Hello, $name!")
			}
		}
		val obj = MyClass("John")
		val prop = obj::name
		val func = obj::sayHello
		println(prop.get()) // prints "John"
		func() // prints "Hello, John!"
	3.Creating a new instance of a class at runtime:
		class MyClass(val name: String) {
			fun sayHello() {
				println("Hello, $name!")
			}
		}
		val constructor = MyClass::class.java.getConstructor(String::class.java)
		val obj = constructor.newInstance("John")
		obj.sayHello() // prints "Hello, John!"
	4.Analyzing annotations on a class or function:
		@Target(AnnotationTarget.CLASS)
		@Retention(AnnotationRetention.RUNTIME)
		annotation class MyAnnotation(val value: String)

		@MyAnnotation("Hello")
		class MyClass

		val annotation = MyClass::class.annotations.firstOrNull { it is MyAnnotation } as? MyAnnotation
		println(annotation?.value) // prints "Hello"
	5.Dynamically loading a class at runtime:
		val className = "com.example.MyClass"
		val klass = Class.forName(className)
		val obj = klass.newInstance() as MyClass

		obj.sayHello() // prints "Hello!"
	These are just a few examples of what Kotlin Reflection can do. With Reflection, you can also analyze and modify code, access class hierarchy information, and more. However, Reflection should be used with caution, as it can have performance implications and can make code harder to understand and maintain.

Class in Kotlin:
Sure! Here are some examples of Kotlin classes, along with detailed explanations:

	Example 1: Basic class declaration
		class Person
		This example declares a basic class called Person. The class body is empty, so this class doesn't have any properties or methods.

	Example 2: Class declaration with a primary constructor
		class Person(name: String, age: Int) {
			init {
				println("Name is $name and age is $age")
			}
		}
		This example declares a class called Person with a primary constructor that takes two parameters: name and age. The constructor is called when a new instance of the class is created, and it prints out the values of name and age using the init block.

	Example 3: Class declaration with secondary constructor

		class Person {
			constructor(name: String, age: Int) {
				println("Name is $name and age is $age")
			}
		}
		This example declares a class called Person with a secondary constructor that takes two parameters: name and age. Secondary constructors are used when you need to provide additional ways to create an instance of the class. In this example, the constructor prints out the values of name and age.

	Example 4: Class declaration with properties

		class Person(val name: String, var age: Int) {
			fun sayHello() {
				println("Hello, my name is $name and I'm $age years old.")
			}
		}
		This example declares a class called Person with two properties: name (a read-only property) and age (a mutable property). The class also has a method called sayHello() that prints out a greeting using the values of name and age.

	Example 5: Class declaration with a companion object

		class MyClass {
			companion object {
				fun sayHello() {
					println("Hello from companion object!")
				}
			}
		}
		This example declares a class called MyClass with a companion object. A companion object is an object that is associated with the class and can be used to define static methods or properties. In this example, the companion object has a method called sayHello() that prints out a greeting.

	Example 6: Class declaration with an inner class

		class OuterClass {
			private val message = "Hello from outer class!"
			
			inner class InnerClass {
				fun printMessage() {
					println(message)
				}
			}
		}
		This example declares a class called OuterClass with an inner class called InnerClass. An inner class is a class that is nested inside another class and has access to its properties and methods. In this example, the InnerClass has a method called printMessage() that prints out the value of a private property called message from the OuterClass.

	These are just a few examples of Kotlin classes. There are many more features available, such as data classes, sealed classes, abstract classes, and more.


Class and object in Kotlin:

	In Kotlin, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an object is a singleton instance of a class. Here are some examples of classes and objects in Kotlin:

		1.Class with Properties and Methods:
			class Person(val name: String, var age: Int) {
				fun sayHello() {
					println("Hello, my name is $name and I am $age years old.")
				}
			}
			val person = Person("John", 25)
			person.sayHello() // prints "Hello, my name is John and I am 25 years old."
		2.Class Inheritance:
			open class Vehicle(val brand: String, var model: String) {
				open fun drive() {
					println("Driving $brand $model.")
				}
			}

			class Car(brand: String, model: String, var color: String) : Vehicle(brand, model) {
				override fun drive() {
					super.drive()
					println("It's a $color $brand $model.")
				}
			}

			val car = Car("Toyota", "Camry", "Red")
			car.drive() // prints "Driving Toyota Camry. It's a Red Toyota Camry."
		3.Object Declaration:

			object MySingleton {
				fun sayHello() {
					println("Hello, I am a Singleton!")
				}
			}

			MySingleton.sayHello() // prints "Hello, I am a Singleton!"
		4.Companion Object:

			class MyClass {
				companion object {
					fun create(): MyClass {
						return MyClass()
					}
				}
			}

			val obj = MyClass.create()
		5.Anonymous Object:

			interface MyInterface {
				fun doSomething()
			}

			val obj = object : MyInterface {
				override fun doSomething() {
					println("Doing something...")
				}
			}

			obj.doSomething() // prints "Doing something..."
		These are just a few examples of classes and objects in Kotlin. With classes, you can create instances of objects with properties and methods, inherit from other classes, and more. With objects, you can create singletons, companion objects, and anonymous objects to provide implementation for interfaces or abstract classes.


Nested and Inner Class
Sure, here are some possible examples of nested and inner classes in Kotlin:
1.Example of a Nested Class:
class OuterClass {
private val outerProperty = "Outer property"

			class NestedClass {
				fun printOuterProperty() {
					// Can't access outerProperty here
					println("Inside nested class")
				}
			}
		}

		fun main() {
			val nested = OuterClass.NestedClass()
			nested.printOuterProperty() // prints "Inside nested class"
		}
		In the above example, NestedClass is a nested class of OuterClass, but it can't access the outerProperty property of the outer class because it is static by default.

	2.Example of an Inner Class:
		class OuterClass {
			private val outerProperty = "Outer property"

			inner class InnerClass {
				fun printOuterProperty() {
					println("Inside inner class: $outerProperty")
				}
			}
		}

		fun main() {
			val outer = OuterClass()
			val inner = outer.InnerClass()
			inner.printOuterProperty() // prints "Inside inner class: Outer property"
		}
		In this example, InnerClass is an inner class of OuterClass, which means it has access to the outerProperty property of the outer class using the this@OuterClass syntax.

	3.Example of a Nested Class with a Companion Object:
		class OuterClass {
			private val outerProperty = "Outer property"

			class NestedClass {
				companion object {
					const val NESTED_PROPERTY = "Nested property"
				}

				fun printProperties() {
					println("Outer property: $outerProperty")
					println("Nested property: ${NestedClass.NESTED_PROPERTY}")
				}
			}
		}

		fun main() {
			val nested = OuterClass.NestedClass()
			nested.printProperties()
			// prints "Outer property: Outer property" and "Nested property: Nested property"
		}
		In this example, NestedClass is a nested class of OuterClass that contains a companion object. The companion object has a constant property that can be accessed using the class name. The printProperties function of NestedClass can access both the outer property and the nested property.

	4.Example of an Inner Class with a Sealed Class:

		sealed class OuterSealed {
			private val sealedProperty = "Sealed property"

			inner class InnerClass {
				fun printSealedProperty() {
					println("Inside inner class: $sealedProperty")
				}
			}
		}

		fun main() {
			val outer = OuterSealed()
			val inner = outer.InnerClass()
			inner.printSealedProperty() // prints "Inside inner class: Sealed property"
		}
		In this example, InnerClass is an inner class of a sealed class called OuterSealed. The sealed class has a private property called sealedProperty, which the InnerClass can access. The sealed class can also have subclasses that inherit from it, but those subclasses cannot access the sealedProperty property.

Kotlin Constructor:
Sure, here are some examples of constructors in Kotlin:

	1.Primary Constructor
		The primary constructor is defined in the class header after the class name. It can contain parameters, which can be used to initialize the properties of the class.

		class Person(val name: String, var age: Int) {
			// ...
		}

		fun main() {
			val person = Person("John", 30)
			println(person.name) // prints "John"
			println(person.age) // prints 30
		}
		In this example, the Person class has a primary constructor that takes two parameters: name (which is a val) and age (which is a var). The constructor initializes the properties of the class with the provided values.

	2.Secondary Constructor
		A secondary constructor is defined in the body of the class using the constructor keyword. It must call the primary constructor using the this keyword.

		class Person(val name: String, var age: Int) {
			constructor() : this("Unknown", 0) {
				// ...
			}
		}

		fun main() {
			val person = Person()
			println(person.name) // prints "Unknown"
			println(person.age) // prints 0
		}
		In this example, the Person class has a secondary constructor that takes no parameters. It calls the primary constructor with default values for name and age.

	3.Init Block
		The init block is executed after the primary constructor and can be used to perform additional initialization logic.

		class Person(val name: String, var age: Int) {
			init {
				println("Person $name created with age $age")
			}
		}

		fun main() {
			val person = Person("John", 30)
			// prints "Person John created with age 30"
		}
		In this example, the Person class has an init block that prints a message when a new instance of the class is created.

	4.Secondary Constructor with Init Block
		A secondary constructor can also include an init block, which will be executed after the primary constructor and before the code inside the secondary constructor.

		class Person(val name: String, var age: Int) {
			constructor() : this("Unknown", 0) {
				init {
					println("Person created with default values")
				}
			}
		}

		fun main() {
			val person = Person()
			// prints "Person created with default values"
		}
		In this example, the Person class has a secondary constructor that includes an init block. When this constructor is used, the message inside the init block will be printed.

	5.Private Constructor
		A private constructor can be used to prevent external instantiation of a class. This is useful for utility classes that contain only static methods.
		class MyUtilityClass private constructor() {
			companion object {
				fun doSomething() {
					println("Utility function called")
				}
			}
		}

		fun main() {
			// This will not compile:
			// val util = MyUtilityClass()
			MyUtilityClass.doSomething() // prints "Utility function called"
		}
		In this example, the MyUtilityClass class has a private constructor that prevents external instantiation of the class. The doSomething function is a static method that can be called on the class without creating an instance.

	6.Inner Class Constructor
		An inner class constructor can be defined inside the inner class header, similar to the primary constructor.

		class OuterClass {
			inner class InnerClass(val name: String) {
				init {
					println("InnerClass created with name $name")
			
				}
			}
		}

		fun main() {
		val outer = OuterClass()
		val inner = outer.InnerClass("John")
		// prints "InnerClass created with name John"
		}
		
		In this example, the OuterClass has an inner class InnerClass with a primary constructor that takes a name parameter. When an instance of InnerClass is created, the init block inside the class will be executed. The inner class can only be instantiated from an instance of the outer class, hence the use of outer.InnerClass("John").
		I hope these examples help illustrate the different ways constructors can be used in Kotlin!

Visibility Modifier in kotlin:
In Kotlin, there are four visibility modifiers that can be used to control the visibility of a class, object, interface, constructor, property, function, or type parameter:

		Public - This is the default visibility modifier in Kotlin. It means that the declaration is visible everywhere, both inside and outside the module.

		Private - This modifier restricts the visibility of a declaration to the containing class or file.

		Protected - This modifier restricts the visibility of a declaration to the containing class and its subclasses.

		Internal - This modifier restricts the visibility of a declaration to the same module. A module is a set of Kotlin files compiled together.

	Here are some examples of how to use these modifiers in Kotlin:

	1.Public Modifier:
		class MyClass {
			val myProperty = 1

			fun myFunction() {
				println("This is a public function")
			}
		}
		In this example, both myProperty and myFunction have the default public visibility modifier. This means that they can be accessed from anywhere in the code, both inside and outside the module.

	2.Private Modifier:
		class MyClass {
			private val myProperty = 1

			private fun myFunction() {
				println("This is a private function")
			}
		}
		In this example, both myProperty and myFunction have the private visibility modifier. This means that they can only be accessed from within the same class. They are not visible from outside the class or from any subclasses.

	3.Protected Modifier:
		open class MyBaseClass {
			protected val myProperty = 1

			protected fun myFunction() {
				println("This is a protected function")
			}
		}

		class MySubClass : MyBaseClass() {
			fun accessParentProperty() {
				println("Parent property value: $myProperty")
			}

			fun accessParentFunction() {
				myFunction()
			}
		}
		In this example, myProperty and myFunction have the protected visibility modifier in the MyBaseClass. This means that they are only visible to the class itself and its subclasses. In the MySubClass, both functions can be accessed by calling them from the subclass.

	4.Internal Modifier:

		internal class MyInternalClass {
			internal val myProperty = 1

			internal fun myFunction() {
				println("This is an internal function")
			}
		}

		fun main() {
			val myClass = MyInternalClass()
			println(myClass.myProperty)
			myClass.myFunction()
		}
		In this example, MyInternalClass, myProperty, and myFunction have the internal visibility modifier. This means that they are only visible within the same module. They cannot be accessed from outside the module.

		I hope these examples help explain the different visibility modifiers available in Kotlin!



Kotlin Inheritance:
Here are some examples of inheritance in Kotlin:

	Example 1: Simple Inheritance
	
		open class Animal(val name: String) {
		  open fun makeSound() {
			println("The animal makes a sound.")
		  }
		}

		class Cat(name: String) : Animal(name) {
		  override fun makeSound() {
			println("Meow!")
		  }
		}

		// Usage:
		val cat = Cat("Fluffy")
		cat.makeSound() // prints "Meow!"
		In this example, Cat inherits from Animal. The Cat class overrides the makeSound method defined in Animal to make the cat sound like "Meow!" instead of the default message. The Cat class also calls the superclass constructor using the Animal(name) syntax.

	Example 2: Overriding Properties
	
		open class Person(var name: String, var age: Int) {
		  open fun getDetails(): String {
			return "Name: $name, Age: $age"
		  }
		}

		class Employee(name: String, age: Int, var salary: Double) : Person(name, age) {
		  override fun getDetails(): String {
			return super.getDetails() + ", Salary: $salary"
		  }
		}

		// Usage:
		val employee = Employee("John Doe", 30, 50000.0)
		println(employee.getDetails()) // prints "Name: John Doe, Age: 30, Salary: 50000.0"
		In this example, Employee inherits from Person. The Employee class overrides the getDetails method defined in Person to include the salary property of the Employee class. The Employee class also calls the superclass implementation of getDetails using super.getDetails() and concatenates the salary to the returned string.

	Example 3: Multiple Inheritance (through Interfaces)

		interface Vehicle {
		  fun start()
		  fun stop()
		}

		interface HasWheels {
		  val numWheels: Int
		}

		class Car(override val numWheels: Int = 4) : Vehicle, HasWheels {
		  override fun start() {
			println("Starting the car...")
		  }

		  override fun stop() {
			println("Stopping the car...")
		  }
		}

		// Usage:
		val car = Car()
		car.start() // prints "Starting the car..."
		car.stop() // prints "Stopping the car..."
		println(car.numWheels) // prints "4"
		In this example, Car implements the Vehicle and HasWheels interfaces. The Vehicle interface defines the start and stop methods, while the HasWheels interface defines the numWheels property. The Car class provides implementations for both methods and property.

	Example 4: Abstract Class

		abstract class Shape(val name: String) {
		  abstract fun getArea(): Double
		  abstract fun getPerimeter(): Double

		  override fun toString(): String {
			return "Shape: $name, Area: ${getArea()}, Perimeter: ${getPerimeter()}"
		  }
		}

		class Rectangle(val width: Double, val height: Double) : Shape("Rectangle") {
		  override fun getArea(): Double {
			return width * height
		  }

		  override fun getPerimeter(): Double {
			return 2 * (width + height)
		  }
		}

		// Usage:
		val rect = Rectangle(5.0, 3.0)
		println(rect) // prints "Shape: Rectangle, Area: 15.0, Perimeter: 16.0"
		In this example, Shape is an abstract class that defines two abstract methods: getArea and getPerimeter. Any class that inherits from Shape must provide implementations for these methods. The Shape class also provides a concrete implementation for the toString method. Rectangle inherits from Shape and provides implementations for getArea and getPerimeter. When the rect object is printed, the toString method defined in Shape is called to produce a formatted string that displays the name of the shape, its area, and its perimeter.

Abstract Class in kotlin:
An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated, meaning you cannot create an object of that class. It is intended to be subclassed by other classes, which implement the abstract methods and/or properties defined in the abstract class.

	Here's an example of an abstract class in Kotlin:

		abstract class Shape(val name: String) {
			abstract fun area(): Double
			abstract fun perimeter(): Double
			open fun description() {
				println("This is a $name")
			}
		}

		class Rectangle(name: String, val width: Double, val height: Double) : Shape(name) {
			override fun area(): Double = width * height
			override fun perimeter(): Double = 2 * (width + height)
		}

		class Circle(name: String, val radius: Double) : Shape(name) {
			override fun area(): Double = Math.PI * radius * radius
			override fun perimeter(): Double = 2 * Math.PI * radius
		}

		fun main() {
			val rectangle = Rectangle("Rectangle", 10.0, 5.0)
			val circle = Circle("Circle", 3.0)

			rectangle.description()
			println("Area of rectangle is ${rectangle.area()}")
			println("Perimeter of rectangle is ${rectangle.perimeter()}")

			circle.description()
			println("Area of circle is ${circle.area()}")
			println("Circumference of circle is ${circle.perimeter()}")
		}
	In this example, Shape is an abstract class with two abstract methods area() and perimeter(), and an open method description(). Rectangle and Circle are concrete classes that inherit from Shape and provide implementations for the abstract methods.

	Note that in order to subclass an abstract class, all of its abstract methods and/or properties must be implemented in the subclass. Additionally, the override keyword is used to indicate that the method is overriding the abstract method defined in the superclass.


Kotlin Interface:
In Kotlin, an interface is a contract that defines a set of methods and/or properties that a class must implement. Here's an example of an interface in Kotlin:

		interface Animal {
			val name: String
			fun makeSound()
			fun move()
		}

		class Dog(override val name: String) : Animal {
			override fun makeSound() {
				println("$name says woof!")
			}

			override fun move() {
				println("$name is running.")
			}
		}

		class Cat(override val name: String) : Animal {
			override fun makeSound() {
				println("$name says meow!")
			}

			override fun move() {
				println("$name is walking.")
			}
		}

		fun main() {
			val dog = Dog("Fido")
			val cat = Cat("Whiskers")

			dog.makeSound()
			dog.move()

			cat.makeSound()
			cat.move()
		}
	In this example, Animal is an interface that defines three methods: name, makeSound(), and move(). Dog and Cat are two classes that implement the Animal interface and provide implementations for the interface methods.

	Note that in order to implement an interface, a class must provide implementations for all of its methods and/or properties. Additionally, the override keyword is used to indicate that the method is implementing the method defined in the interface.


Data Class in kotlin:
Sure, here are some examples of how to use the data class in Kotlin with explanations:
1.Basic data class with properties:
data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int)
This is a basic example of a data class that contains two properties: name of type String and age of type Int. Data classes automatically generate equals(), hashCode(), and toString() methods based on their properties.

	2.Data class with properties and functions:
		data class Rectangle(val width: Int, val height: Int) {
			fun area() = width * height
		}
		This is another example of a data class that contains two properties: width and height. Additionally, it has a function area() that calculates the area of the rectangle.

	3.Data class with default values:
		data class Car(val make: String, val model: String, val year: Int = 2022)
		This example is similar to the first example, but it also contains a default value for the year property. If a value is not provided for year when creating an instance of Car, it defaults to 2022.

	4.Data class with a nullable property:
		data class User(val name: String, val email: String?)
		This example shows how to define a nullable property in a data class. The email property is marked with a ?, which means it can be null. This is useful when you have optional data that may or may not be present.

	5.Data class with a custom equals() function:
		data class Point(val x: Int, val y: Int) {
			override fun equals(other: Any?): Boolean {
				if (other == null || other !is Point) {
					return false
				}
				return x == other.x && y == other.y
			}
		}
		By default, data classes use the properties defined in the class for equality checks. However, you can override the equals() function to provide your own custom equality check. In this example, the equals() function checks if the x and y properties of two Point objects are equal.

	6.Data class with a copy() function:
		data class Book(val title: String, val author: String, val year: Int) {
			fun copy(title: String = this.title, author: String = this.author, year: Int = this.year) = Book(title, author, year)
		}
		Data classes also have a copy() function that allows you to create a new instance of the data class with updated properties. This is useful when you want to make a copy of an object with some changes to its properties. In this example, the copy() function creates a new Book object with the same author and year properties, but a new title property.

		These are just a few examples of how to use data classes in Kotlin. Data classes are useful when you need to represent plain old data structures, such as domain objects or transfer objects, and they provide a lot of functionality out of the box.


Sealed Class in kotlin :
A sealed class in Kotlin is a special kind of abstract class that is used to represent restricted class hierarchies. A sealed class can be subclassed, but only within the same file where it is declared. This makes it useful when you have a limited number of possible subclasses, and you want to ensure that all of them are handled in a particular way.

	Here is an example of a sealed class hierarchy in Kotlin:
		sealed class Animal {
			abstract fun makeSound()
		}

		class Dog : Animal() {
			override fun makeSound() {
				println("Woof!")
			}
		}

		class Cat : Animal() {
			override fun makeSound() {
				println("Meow!")
			}
		}

		class Bird : Animal() {
			override fun makeSound() {
				println("Tweet!")
			}
		}
	In this example, the Animal class is declared as a sealed class. This means that it can only be subclassed in the same file where it is declared. The Dog, Cat, and Bird classes are subclasses of Animal.

	To use this hierarchy, you can create an instance of one of the subclasses and call its makeSound method:
		fun main() {
			val dog = Dog()
			val cat = Cat()
			val bird = Bird()

			dog.makeSound() // Output: Woof!
			cat.makeSound() // Output: Meow!
			bird.makeSound() // Output: Tweet!
		}
	Another example of using sealed classes is to represent the state of a UI component:

		sealed class UIState {
			object Loading : UIState()
			class Success(val data: List<String>) : UIState()
			class Error(val message: String) : UIState()
		}

		fun updateUI(state: UIState) {
			when (state) {
				is UIState.Loading -> showLoadingScreen()
				is UIState.Success -> showData(state.data)
				is UIState.Error -> showError(state.message)
			}
		}
	In this example, the UIState class is declared as a sealed class. It has three subclasses: Loading, Success, and Error. Each of these subclasses can have additional properties or methods. The updateUI function takes a UIState object and uses pattern matching to determine which subclass it belongs to. Depending on the subclass, it calls a different function to update the UI.

	Overall, sealed classes are a powerful tool in Kotlin for modeling restricted class hierarchies. They can help you write safer and more concise code by enforcing that all possible cases are handled in a certain way.



Extension Function in kotlin :

	In Kotlin, extension functions allow you to add new functionality to existing classes without having to modify their source code. Here are some examples of extension functions in Kotlin:
	1.Adding an extension function to the String class to capitalize the first letter of a string:

		fun String.capitalizeFirstLetter(): String {
			if (this.isEmpty()) {
				return ""
			}
			return this.substring(0, 1).toUpperCase() + this.substring(1)
		}
	2.Adding an extension function to the List class to shuffle the elements of a list:

		fun <T> List<T>.shuffle(): List<T> {
			val shuffledList = this.toMutableList()
			Collections.shuffle(shuffledList)
			return shuffledList
		}
	3.Adding an extension function to the Int class to convert an integer to a Roman numeral:

		fun Int.toRomanNumeral(): String {
			val values = listOf(1000, 900, 500, 400, 100, 90, 50, 40, 10, 9, 5, 4, 1)
			val symbols = listOf("M", "CM", "D", "CD", "C", "XC", "L", "XL", "X", "IX", "V", "IV", "I")
			var num = this
			var romanNumeral = ""
			for (i in values.indices) {
				while (num >= values[i]) {
					romanNumeral += symbols[i]
					num -= values[i]
				}
			}
			return romanNumeral
		}
	4.Adding an extension function to the ImageView class to load an image from a URL:

		fun ImageView.loadUrl(url: String) {
			Picasso.get().load(url).into(this)
		}
	5.Adding an extension function to the CharSequence class to check if a string contains only digits:

		fun CharSequence.isDigitsOnly(): Boolean {
			return this.all { it.isDigit() }
		}
	These are just a few examples of what you can do with extension functions in Kotlin. The possibilities are endless, and you can add extension functions to any class or interface that you want to extend with new functionality.


Kotlin Generics:
Sure, I'd be happy to explain the examples I provided for Kotlin generics with some sample programs.

	1.Simple generic class:
		class Box<T>(val item: T)

		val intBox = Box(42)
		val stringBox = Box("Hello, world!")
		In this example, Box is a simple generic class with a single type parameter T. The class has a property item of type T, which can hold any type that is passed as the type argument when creating an instance of the class. We create two instances of the Box class, one with an integer and one with a string.

	2.Generic function:

		fun <T> printItem(item: T) {
			println(item)
		}

		printItem("Hello, world!")
		printItem(42)
		In this example, printItem is a generic function that takes an argument of any type T and prints it to the console. We call the function twice with different types of arguments, a string and an integer.

	3.Generic extension function:

		fun <T> List<T>.secondOrNull(): T? {
			if (size < 2) {
				return null
			}
			return this[1]
		}

		val myList = listOf(1, 2, 3)
		val secondItem = myList.secondOrNull()
		In this example, we define an extension function secondOrNull for the List class that returns the second item in the list, or null if there is no second item. We create a list of integers and call the secondOrNull function on it to retrieve the second item.

	4.Generic interface:

		interface ListFilter<T> {
			fun filter(list: List<T>, predicate: (T) -> Boolean): List<T>
		}

		class StringListFilter : ListFilter<String> {
			override fun filter(list: List<String>, predicate: (String) -> Boolean): List<String> {
				return list.filter(predicate)
			}
		}

		val myList = listOf("apple", "banana", "cherry")
		val filteredList = StringListFilter().filter(myList) { it.length > 5 }
		In this example, we define a generic interface ListFilter with a single type parameter T and a method filter that takes a list of type T and a predicate function that returns true for items that should be included in the filtered list. We then create a class StringListFilter that implements the ListFilter interface with type argument String and filters a list of strings based on the predicate function.

	5.Generic constraint:

		class NumberBox<T : Number>(val item: T)

		val intBox = NumberBox(42)
		val doubleBox = NumberBox(3.14)
		In this example, NumberBox is a generic class that only accepts type arguments that are subclasses of Number. This is achieved using the type constraint T : Number. We create two instances of the NumberBox class, one with an integer and one with a double.

	6.Multiple generic types:

		class Pair<T, U>(val first: T, val second: U)

		val myPair = Pair(42, "Hello, world!")
		val anotherPair = Pair("pi", 3.14)
		In this example, Pair is a generic class that has two type parameters T and U. The class represents a pair of two items, one of type T and one of type U. We create two instances of the Pair class, one with an integer and a string, and one with a string and a double.
		
	7.Generic class with multiple constraints:

		class AnimalShelter<T>(private val animals: List<T>) where T : Animal, T : Adoptable {
			fun adopt(animal: T): Boolean {
				if (animal in animals) {
					return animals.remove(animal)
				}
				return false
			}
		}

		interface Animal {
			val name: String
		}

		interface Adoptable {
			fun adopt(): Boolean
		}

		class Dog(override val name: String) : Animal, Adoptable {
			override fun adopt(): Boolean {
				println("$name has been adopted!")
				return true
			}
		}

		class Cat(override val name: String) : Animal {
			fun meow() {
				println("Meow!")
			}
		}

		val animalList = listOf(Dog("Rex"), Dog("Fido"), Cat("Whiskers"))
		val shelter = AnimalShelter(animalList)
		shelter.adopt(Dog("Rex")) // returns true
		shelter.adopt(Cat("Whiskers")) // returns false
	In this example, AnimalShelter is a generic class that takes a list of animals as its type parameter. The class has two constraints, T : Animal and T : Adoptable, meaning that the type argument must be a subclass of both Animal and Adoptable. The Animal interface defines a property name, while the Adoptable interface defines a method adopt that returns a boolean value indicating whether the adoption was successful. The Dog and Cat classes implement the Animal interface, and the Dog class also implements the Adoptable interface. We create a list of animals and an AnimalShelter instance that takes the list as its argument. We then attempt to adopt two animals from the shelter using the adopt method, which returns true for a dog that is in the shelter and false for a cat that is not in the shelter.



Kotlin Ranges:
Kotlin range is defined as an interval from start value to the end value. Range expressions are created with operator (. .)
Integral Type Ranges:
fun main(args: Array<String>) {  
for (a in 1..5){  
print(a )  
}  
println()  
for(x in 'a'..'f'){  
print(x )  
}  
println()  
val range = 1.0..5.0  
println(range)  
println("3.14 in range is ${3.14 in range}")  
}

	Output:
		12345
		abcdef
		1.0..5.0
		3.14 in range is true
		
	What happened when we try to iterate a r range in decreasing order using . . operator ? This will print nothing.
	for (a in 5..1){
        print(a )// print nothing
    }
	To iterate the element in decreasing order, use the standard library downTo() function or downTo keyword.
	for (a in 5 downTo 1){  
        print(a )// 54321  
    }
	
	until range:
		The until() function or until keyword in range is used to exclude the last element. It iterates range from start to 1 less than end.
		for (a in 1 until 5){  
			print(a ) // print 1234  
		} 
	The above range excludes 5 and iterate from 1 to 4.
	
	Kotlin range of integer:
		fun main(args: Array<String>) {  
				for (x in 1..5)  
					print(x)  
		println()  
				for (x in 5 downTo 1)  
					print(x)  
		println()  
				for (x in 1.rangeTo(5))  
					print(x)  
		println()  
				for (x in 5.downTo(1))  
					print(x)  
		println()  
			} 
	
	Output:
		12345
		54321
		12345
		54321
		
	Kotlin range of characters:
		fun main(args: Array<String>) {  
		 (x in 'a'..'e')  
				print("$x ")  
		ntln()  
			for (x in 'e' downTo 'a')  
				print("$x ")  
		}
		
	Output:
		a bcde
		edcba
		
	Kotlin range step:
		Kotlin step keyword in range is used to iterate the range in the interval of given step value (int value).
		fun main(args: Array<String>) {  
			for (x in 1..10 step 2)  
				print("$x ")  
		println()  
				for (x in 10 downTo 1 step 3)  
					print("$x ")  
			}  
			
		Output:
		1 3 5 7 9 
		10 7 4 1
		
	Kotlin range iterator:
		An iterator() method is also be used to iterate the range value. It uses hasNext() method which checks the next element in the range and next() method returns the next element of the range.
		fun main(args: Array<String>) {  
  
		val chars = ('a'..'e')  
		val it = chars.iterator()  
			while (it.hasNext()) {  
		val x = it.next()  
				print("$x ")  
			}  
		}  
		
		Output:
			a b c d e


Working of ranges in kotlin:
In Kotlin, the range is a type of collection that represents an interval of values. The range is defined by its start and end values, which can be of any comparable type such as Int, Char, or Date. The range can be created using the .. operator or the rangeTo() function. Here are some examples of how ranges work in Kotlin:

	1.Creating a range using the .. operator:
		val range1 = 1..10 // a range from 1 to 10 (inclusive)
		val range2 = 'a'..'z' // a range from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive)
		val range3 = 10.0..20.0 // a range from 10.0 to 20.0 (inclusive)
	2.Creating a range using the rangeTo() function:
		val range4 = 1.rangeTo(10) // a range from 1 to 10 (inclusive)
		val range5 = 'a'.rangeTo('z') // a range from 'a' to 'z' (inclusive)
		val range6 = 10.0.rangeTo(20.0) // a range from 10.0 to 20.0 (inclusive)
	3.Using a range in a loop:
		for (i in 1..10) {
			println(i) // prints 1 to 10
		}

		for (ch in 'a'..'z') {
			print(ch + " ") // prints a to z
		}

		for (num in 10.0..20.0 step 0.5) {
			print(num + " ") // prints 10.0 10.5 11.0 ... 20.0
		}
	4.Checking if a value is in a range:
		val range7 = 1..10
		println(5 in range7) // true
		println(15 in range7) // false
	5.Using a range to filter a collection:
		val list = listOf(1, 5, 10, 15, 20)
		val filteredList = list.filter { it in 5..15 }
		println(filteredList) // prints [5, 10, 15]
	6.Using a range to generate a sequence:
		val sequence = generateSequence(1) { it + 1 }.takeWhile { it <= 10 }
		println(sequence.toList()) // prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
	These are some examples of how ranges work in Kotlin. Ranges are very useful for iterating over a sequence of values or filtering a collection based on a range of values.


Calling Java code from Kotlin:
Sure! Here are some examples of calling Java code from Kotlin:

	1.Calling a static Java method:
		Java code:
			public class MyJavaClass {
				public static void myMethod() {
					System.out.println("Hello from Java!");
				}
			}
		Kotlin code:
			MyJavaClass.myMethod()
	2.Accessing a Java static field:
		Java code:
			public class MyJavaClass {
				public static String MY_STRING = "Hello from Java!";
			}
		Kotlin code:
			val myString = MyJavaClass.MY_STRING
	3.Creating an instance of a Java class:
		Java code:
			public class MyJavaClass {
				public String myString;

				public MyJavaClass(String myString) {
					this.myString = myString;
				}

				public void printString() {
					System.out.println(myString);
				}
			}
		Kotlin code:
			val myJavaObject = MyJavaClass("Hello from Java!")
			myJavaObject.printString()
	4.Calling a Java instance method with parameters:
		Java code:
			public class MyJavaClass {
				public void printString(String stringToPrint) {
					System.out.println(stringToPrint);
				}
			}
		Kotlin code:
			val myJavaObject = MyJavaClass()
			myJavaObject.printString("Hello from Java!")
	5.Implementing a Java interface:
		Java code:
			public interface MyJavaInterface {
				void myMethod();
			}
		Java code:
			public class MyJavaClass implements MyJavaInterface {
				public void myMethod() {
					System.out.println("Hello from Java!");
				}
			}
		Kotlin code:
			class MyKotlinClass : MyJavaInterface {
				override fun myMethod() {
					println("Hello from Kotlin!")
				}
			}

			val myJavaObject = MyJavaClass()
			myJavaObject.myMethod()
	These are just a few examples of how to call Java code from Kotlin. In general, you can call Java classes and methods from Kotlin as you would in Java. Kotlin is interoperable with Java, so you can easily use Java libraries and code in your Kotlin projects.


Regular Expressions:
Sure! Here are some examples of using regular expressions in Kotlin:

	1.Matching a pattern in a string:
		val inputString = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
		val pattern = Regex("fox")

		if (pattern.containsMatchIn(inputString)) {
			println("Match found!")
		} else {
			println("Match not found.")
		}
		Output:
			Match found!
	2.Replacing a pattern in a string:
		val inputString = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
		val pattern = Regex("fox")

		val outputString = pattern.replace(inputString, "cat")
		println(outputString)
		Output:
			The quick brown cat jumps over the lazy dog.
	3.Extracting parts of a string using groups:
		val inputString = "John Smith (123) 456-7890"
		val pattern = Regex("^(\\w+) (\\w+) \\((\\d{3})\\) (\\d{3})-(\\d{4})$")

		val matchResult = pattern.find(inputString)
		if (matchResult != null) {
			val (firstName, lastName, areaCode, firstThree, lastFour) = matchResult.destructured
			println("First name: $firstName")
			println("Last name: $lastName")
			println("Phone number: $areaCode-$firstThree-$lastFour")
		} else {
			println("Match not found.")
		}
		Output:
			First name: John
			Last name: Smith
			Phone number: 123-456-7890
	4.Splitting a string based on a pattern:
		val inputString = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
		val pattern = Regex("\\s+")

		val words = pattern.split(inputString)
		for (word in words) {
			println(word)
		}
		Output:
			The
			quick
			brown
			fox
			jumps
			over
			the
			lazy
			dog.
			These are just a few examples of how to use regular expressions in Kotlin. Regular expressions can be used for a wide range of string manipulation tasks, including validation, search and replace, and text parsing.



Kotlin TextView

	Sure, here are some examples of using TextView in Kotlin for various use cases:

	1.Setting text and text appearance programmatically:

		val myTextView = findViewById<TextView>(R.id.my_text_view)

		myTextView.text = "Hello, world!"
		myTextView.setTextColor(ContextCompat.getColor(this, R.color.textColor))
		myTextView.textSize = 18f
	2.Setting text and text appearance using XML:
	
		<TextView
			android:id="@+id/my_text_view"
			android:layout_width="wrap_content"
			android:layout_height="wrap_content"
			android:text="Hello, world!"
			android:textColor="@color/textColor"
			android:textSize="18sp" />
	3.Setting text with a custom font:

		val myTextView = findViewById<TextView>(R.id.my_text_view)
		val typeface = Typeface.createFromAsset(assets, "fonts/myfont.ttf")

		myTextView.typeface = typeface
		myTextView.text = "Hello, world!"
	4.Setting text with HTML formatting:

		val myTextView = findViewById<TextView>(R.id.my_text_view)
		val htmlText = "<b>Hello</b>, <i>world</i>!"

		myTextView.text = HtmlCompat.fromHtml(htmlText, HtmlCompat.FROM_HTML_MODE_COMPACT)
	5.Handling TextView click events:

		val myTextView = findViewById<TextView>(R.id.my_text_view)
		myTextView.setOnClickListener {
			Toast.makeText(this, "TextView clicked!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
		}
	6.Displaying an image in a TextView using SpannableString:

		val myTextView = findViewById<TextView>(R.id.my_text_view)
		val drawable = ContextCompat.getDrawable(this, R.drawable.my_image)

		drawable?.let {
			it.setBounds(0, 0, it.intrinsicWidth, it.intrinsicHeight)
			val spannableString = SpannableString("Hello, ")
			spannableString.setSpan(ImageSpan(it), 6, 7, Spanned.SPAN_EXCLUSIVE_EXCLUSIVE)
			spannableString.append("world!")

			myTextView.text = spannableString
		}
	These are just a few examples of how to use TextView in Kotlin for different use cases. The TextView class provides a wide range of customization options and can be used for various text display purposes in an Android app.


Kotlin EditText:
Sure, here are some examples of using EditText in Kotlin for various use cases:

	1.Retrieving text from an EditText:
	
		val myEditText = findViewById<EditText>(R.id.my_edit_text)
		val text = myEditText.text.toString()
	2.Setting a hint and limiting the number of characters:
	
		<EditText
			android:id="@+id/my_edit_text"
			android:layout_width="match_parent"
			android:layout_height="wrap_content"
			android:hint="Enter your name"
			android:maxLength="50" />
	3.Handling input validation:
	
		val myEditText = findViewById<EditText>(R.id.my_edit_text)

		if (myEditText.text.isNullOrEmpty()) {
			myEditText.error = "Please enter your name"
		} else {
			val name = myEditText.text.toString()
			// do something with the name
		}
	3.Disabling editing:
	
		val myEditText = findViewById<EditText>(R.id.my_edit_text)
		myEditText.isEnabled = false
	4.Password input with masking:
	
		<EditText
			android:id="@+id/my_edit_text"
			android:layout_width="match_parent"
			android:layout_height="wrap_content"
			android:inputType="textPassword"
			android:maxLength="20" />
	5.Using a custom input type with a regular expression:
	
		val myEditText = findViewById<EditText>(R.id.my_edit_text)
		myEditText.addTextChangedListener(object : TextWatcher {
			override fun afterTextChanged(s: Editable?) {}

			override fun beforeTextChanged(s: CharSequence?, start: Int, count: Int, after: Int) {}

			override fun onTextChanged(s: CharSequence?, start: Int, before: Int, count: Int) {
				val pattern = Regex("[^\\d.-]")
				val text = s.toString().replace(pattern, "")
				myEditText.setText(text)
				myEditText.setSelection(text.length)
			}
		})
	6.Listening for changes in text:
	
		val myEditText = findViewById<EditText>(R.id.my_edit_text)
		myEditText.addTextChangedListener(object : TextWatcher {
			override fun afterTextChanged(s: Editable?) {
				// do something with the updated text
			}

			override fun beforeTextChanged(s: CharSequence?, start: Int, count: Int, after: Int) {}

			override fun onTextChanged(s: CharSequence?, start: Int, before: Int, count: Int) {}
		})
	These are just a few examples of how to use EditText in Kotlin for different use cases. The EditText class provides a wide range of customization options and can be used for various text input purposes in an Android app.



Kotlin Android Toast:
In Android, Toast is a small popup message that shows a brief message to the user. Here are some examples of using Toast in Kotlin for different use cases:

	1.Displaying a simple Toast message:
	
		Toast.makeText(context, "Hello World", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
	2.Displaying a long duration Toast message:

		Toast.makeText(context, "This is a long message", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
	3.Displaying a custom Toast message with a custom layout:

		val inflater = layoutInflater
		val layout = inflater.inflate(R.layout.custom_toast_layout, findViewById(R.id.custom_toast_container))

		val toast = Toast(context)
		toast.duration = Toast.LENGTH_SHORT
		toast.view = layout
		toast.show()
		In the above code, we first inflate the custom layout R.layout.custom_toast_layout using the layoutInflater. We then create a new Toast object and set the duration to Toast.LENGTH_SHORT. We then set the view of the Toast to our custom layout using the view property, and finally, we show the Toast using the show() method.

	4.Displaying a Toast message on the main thread using runOnUiThread:
	
		runOnUiThread {
			Toast.makeText(context, "This is a message on the main thread", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
		}
	In this code, we use the runOnUiThread method to run the Toast message on the main thread, which is required when trying to update the UI from a background thread.
	These are just a few examples of how to use Toast in Kotlin for different use cases. The Toast class provides a variety of customization options and can be used to show different types of messages to the user in an Android app.

kotlin Android Button:
In Android, a Button is a UI component that allows the user to perform an action or navigate to another screen. Here are some examples of using Button in Kotlin for different use cases:

	1.Handling button clicks:

		val myButton = findViewById<Button>(R.id.my_button)
		myButton.setOnClickListener {
			// do something when the button is clicked
		}
	2.Disabling the button:
	
		val myButton = findViewById<Button>(R.id.my_button)
		myButton.isEnabled = false
	3.Changing the text of the button:
		val myButton = findViewById<Button>(R.id.my_button)
		myButton.text = "Click me"
	4.Changing the background color of the button:
		val myButton = findViewById<Button>(R.id.my_button)
		myButton.setBackgroundColor(Color.BLUE)
	5.Adding a ripple effect to the button:
		<Button
			android:id="@+id/my_button"
			android:layout_width="wrap_content"
			android:layout_height="wrap_content"
			android:text="Click me"
			android:background="?attr/selectableItemBackground" />
		In this example, we set the background attribute of the Button to ?attr/selectableItemBackground, which adds a ripple effect to the button when it is clicked.

	6.Styling the button with a custom background drawable:

		<Button
			android:id="@+id/my_button"
			android:layout_width="wrap_content"
			android:layout_height="wrap_content"
			android:text="Click me"
			android:background="@drawable/custom_button_background" />
		In this example, we set the background attribute of the Button to a custom drawable resource @drawable/custom_button_background that defines the background color, stroke, and corner radius of the button.

		These are just a few examples of how to use Button in Kotlin for different use cases. The Button class provides a variety of customization options and can be used to create different types of UI elements in an Android app.




View binding::

	View binding is a feature in Android that allows you to easily access views in your layout files using a generated binding class. By using view binding, you can eliminate the need to call findViewById and reduce the risk of null pointer exceptions.
	build.gradle::
		buildFeatures {
			viewBinding = true
		}
		
	XML::
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
	<RelativeLayout 
		tools:context=".MainActivity ">
		 <TextView
			android:id="@+id/textView"
			android:layout_width="wrap_content"
			android:layout_height="wrap_content"
			android:text="Hello, world!" />
	</RelativeLayout>
	
	Kotlin::
		import com.example.myapp.databinding.ActivityMainBinding
		
		class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
			private lateinit var binding: ActivityMainBinding

			override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
				super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
				binding = ActivityMainBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
				setContentView(binding.root)
				binding.textView.text = "Hello, view binding!"
			}
		}
